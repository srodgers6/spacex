<h2>History of SpaceX</h2>

<h3>History</h3>
<a href="#header">Back to top</a>

<p>
  In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars,
containing seeds with dehydrated gel, hydrating the gel and having plants grow on Martian soil, "so this would
be the furthest that life's ever traveled"[14] in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and
increase the Budget of NASA.[15][16][17] But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel
to Mars would be prohibitively expensive and that a fundamental breakthrough in rocket technology was needed.
[17] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with <em>Jim Cantrell</em> (an aerospace supplies fixer), and <em>Adeo Ressi</em>
(his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could send the envisioned payloads into
space.[18] The group met with companies such as Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras. However, according to
Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers, and the
group returned to the US empty-handed.[19] In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three
ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and spacecraft.
The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by
Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk
realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[19] According to early
Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[20] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket
actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration-principally
for cost reasons;[18] around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon vehicle is produced in-house[21][22]- and the
modular approach from software engineering (Falcon 9 uses 9 of the Merlin engines, which were tested on the
single engine Falcon 1, Falcon Heavy uses three Falcon 9 booster stages), SpaceX could cut launch price by a
factor of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin.[23] Another reason for vertical integration is that Musk
thinks reusable rockets cannot be built with components from existing suppliers, that all the other aerospace
companies are buying from as well. For example, SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld
aluminium-lithium alloy for the airframe of the Falcon 9, because such a machine did not exist anywhere in the
world.[24] According to Musk, SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket (Falcon 1 with about half a
ton to orbit), instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and
bankrupted the company.[25]
</p>
<p>
In early 2002, Musk was seeking staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached
renowned rocket engineer <em>Tom Mueller</em> (now SpaceX's VP of Propulsion), Mueller agreed to work for Musk and
SpaceX was born.[26] SpaceX was first headquartered in a 75,000 square feet warehouse in El Segundo,
California. Musk decided SpaceX's first rocket would be named Falcon 1, a nod to Star Wars' Millennium
Falcon. Musk planned for Falcon 1's first launch to occur in November 2003, 15 months after the company
started.[19]</p>

<p>In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology.[27]</p>

<p>By March 2006, Musk had invested US$100 million of his own money into the company.[28]
On August 4, 2008, SpaceX accepted a further $20 million investment from Founders Fund.[29] In early 2012,
approximately two-thirds of the company was owned by its founder[30] and his 70 million shares were then
estimated to be worth $875 million on private markets,[31] which roughly valued SpaceX at $1.3 billion as of
February 2012.[32] After the COTS 2+ flight in May 2012, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled
to $2.4 billion.[33][34]</p>

<p>On 16 June 2009, SpaceX announced the opening of its Astronaut Safety and Mission Assurance Department. It
hired former NASA astronaut Ken Bowersox to oversee the department as a vice president of the company.[35]
However, it has since been reported that the former astronaut subsequently left SpaceX in late 2011. No reason
was given and no replacement in that position has been announced.[ 36]</p>

<p>In 2010, Musk's calculations convinced him that the colonization of Mars was possible.[37]</p>

<p>In 2012, an initial public offering (IPO) was perceived as possible by the end of 2013,[38] but then Musk stated
in June 2013 that he planned to hold off any potential IPO until after the "<em>Mars Colonial Transporter</em> is flying
regularly,"[39] and this was reiterated in 2015 indicating that it would be many years before SpaceX would
become a publicly traded company,[40][41] where Musk stated that "I just don't want [SpaceX] to be controlled
by some private equity firm that would milk it for near-term revenue"[42]</p>

<p>The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2002, growing from 160 employees in November 2005
to more than 500 by July 2008, to over 1,100 in 2010,[43][44] 1,800 in early 2012,[45] and 3,000 by early 2013.
[46] The company had grown to 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013,[47] and had "nearly 5,000"
in late 2015[1] and February 2016.[2]</p>

<p><em>Achievements of SpaceX</em> include:[48]
<ul>
  <li>The first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket (Falcon 1) to reach orbit (28 September 2008)</li>
  <li>The first privately funded company to successfully launch (by Falcon 9) orbit and recover a spacecraft
(Dragon) (9 December 2010)</li>
  <li>The first private company to send a spacecraft (Dragon) to the International Space Station (25 May 2012)</li>
  <li>The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit (SES-8, 3 December 2013)</li>
  <li>The first landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9) (22 December 2015 1:39 UTC)</li>
  <li>The first water landing of a first stage orbital capable rocket (Falcon 9) (8 April 2016 20:53 UTC)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  On 22 December 2015 at around 1:29 UTC SpaceX launched an upgraded Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral
Air Force Station into low Earth orbit. After completing its primary burn, the first stage of the multistage rocket
detached from the second stage as usual. The first stage then fired some of its engines to send it back to Cape
Canaveral, where it achieved the world's first successful landing of a rocket that was used for an orbital launch.
The landing happened at around 1:39 UTC on December 22. Stage two successfully deployed eleven
communication satellites for Orbcomm.
</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<a href="#header">Back to top</a>

<p>
  Number of SpaceX launches per year SpaceX is privately funded.[50] It developed its first launch vehicle-Falcon
1-and three rocket engines-Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco-completely with private capital. SpaceX contracted with
the US government for a portion of the development funding for the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which uses a
modified version of the Merlin rocket engine.[50] SpaceX is developing the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle,[51]
the Raptor methane-fueled rocket engine,[52] and a set of reusable launch vehicle technologies with private
capital.[53]
</p>

<p>
  As of May 2012, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion in its first ten years of
operation. Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other
investors having put in about $100M (Founders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...).[54] The remainder has come
from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. As of April 2012, NASA had
put in about $400â€“500M of this amount, with most of that as progress payments on launch contracts.[55] By
May 2012, SpaceX had contracts for 40 launch missions, and each of those contracts provide down payments at
contract signing, plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components are built in advance of
mission launch, driven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing long-term revenue.[55]
</p>

<p>
  In August 2012, <em>SpaceX signed a large development contract with NASA to design and develop a crew-carrying
space capsule</em> for the "next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities", in order to re-enable the launch of
astronauts from U.S. soil by 2017. Two other companies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, received
similar development contracts. Advances made by all three companies under Space Act Agreements through
NASA's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) initiative are intended to ultimately lead to the
availability of commercial human spaceflight services for both government and commercial customers. As part
of this agreement, SpaceX was awarded a contract worth up to $440 million for contract deliverables between
2012 and May 2014.[56][57]
</p>

<p>
  At year-end 2012, SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest representing about $4 billion in contract
revenue-with many of those contracts already making progress payments to SpaceX-with both commercial and
government (NASA/DOD) customers.[58] As of December 2013, SpaceX has a total of 50 future launches under
contract, two-thirds of them are for commercial customers.[59][60] In late 2013, space industry media began to
comment on the phenomenon that SpaceX prices are undercutting the major competitors in the commercial
commsat launch market-the Ariane 5 and Proton-M[61]-at which time SpaceX had at least 10 further
geostationary orbit flights on its books.[60]
</p>

<p>
  In January 2015, <em>SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity</em>, in exchange for 8.333% of the
company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion. Google and Fidelity joined the then
current investorship group of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn.[62]
[63] Although the investment was thought to be related to SpaceX's launch of a satellite construction business
and global satellite internet service effort,[64] Gwynne Shotwell said in March 2015 that the investment was not
specifically for the global internet project.[65] Google had been searching for a satellite internet partner since the
split with O3b Networks and OneWeb.[66]
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<a href="#header">Back to top</a>

<p>
  Conceptual render of Falcon Heavy at Pad 39A, Cape Canaveral Musk has stated that one of his goals is to
improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[67] The company plans in 2004
called for "development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand" with each
size increase resulting in a significant decrease in cost per pound to orbit. CEO Elon Musk said: "I believe $500
per pound ($1,100/kg) or less is very achievable."[68]
</p>

<p>
  SpaceX has on occasion developed new engineering development technologies to enable it to pursue its various
goals. In 2015, public sources revealed that SpaceX is developing their own computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
software to improve the simulation capability of evaluating rocket engine combustion design.[69]
</p>

<p>
  In June 2015 the company asked the federal government for permission to begin testing for a project that aims to
build a constellation of 4000 satellites capable of beaming the Internet to the entire globe, including remote
regions which currently do not have internet access.[70][71]
</p>

<h4>Mars</h4>

<p>
  He stated in a 2011 interview that he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10â€“20 years.[72] In June
2013, Musk used the descriptor Mars Colonial Transporter to refer to the privately funded development project
to design and build a spaceflight system of rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules to transport
humans to Mars and return to Earth.[39] In March 2014, COO Gwynne Shotwell said that once the Falcon
Heavy and Dragon v2 crew version are flying, the focus for the company engineering team will be on developing
the technology to support the transport infrastructure necessary for Mars missions.[73]
</p>

<p>
  Musk's long term vision for the company is the development of technology and resources suitable for human
colonization on Mars. He has expressed his interest in someday traveling to the planet, stating "I'd like to die on
Mars, just not on impact."[74] To achieve it, Musk plans to establish cargo flights to Mars, getting the first
delivery there by 2018. A rocket every two years or so after that could provide a base for the people arriving in
2025 after a launch in 2024.[75][76] According to Steve Jurvetson, Musk believes that by 2035 at the latest,
there will be thousands of rockets flying a million people to Mars, in order to enable a self-sustaining human
colony.[77]
</p>

<h4>Reusable rockets</h4>
<p>
Main articles: SpaceX reusable launch system development program and Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests
</p>

<p>
  Just Read the Instructions in position prior to Falcon 9 Flight 17 carrying CRS-6 SpaceX has been improving the
autonomous landing and recovery of the first stage of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with increasing success. As a
result of Elon Musk's goal of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse
the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9,[78] by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid
surfaces. Once the company determined that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and
Pacific ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit
out at sea as a target for the returning first stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).
</p>

<p>
  On January 10, 2015 CRS-5, or Commercial Resupply Service 5, launched with the rocket stage set to be the
first to land on a solid surface and be recovered intact.[78] The craft made it to the ASDS, though it came in too
fast and at an angle, exploding on the surface of the ship and scattering debris on its surface and in the ocean.
The drone ship experienced some structural damages, but nothing irreparable. The cause of the failed landing
was determined a failure of the grid fins used on the craft during the descent to stabilize it, which ran out of
hydraulic fluid and ceased to function properly.[79]
</p>

<p>
  On their next attempt, during the CRS-6 mission, SpaceX was once again able to hit their target, however two
issues occurred during the landing. The first was that the craft came in with a higher than expected lateral
velocity, though the craft still made contact with the ASDS. Since the spacecraft was drifting sideways, the
bipropellant for the rocket's attitude control should have kept it from tipping, however a valve became stuck and
kept the craft from reacting to the issue quickly. The rocket once again tipped over and was mostly destroyed. In
both cases, debris was recovered and examined by SpaceX. Though both landings of the rocket stages resulted in
failures, the primary mission was successful- the Dragon capsules for each mission made it to the International
Space Station safely and later splashed down in the Pacific ocean.[80]
</p>

<p>
  On the next attempt, December 21, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage for the first time for an
orbital launch, landing the first stage booster from their second mission for Orbcomm at Landing Zone 1 at
Kennedy Space Center (a Return To Launch Site landing).[81]
</p>

<p>
  In January 2016 another ASDS landing attempt was made during the launch of the Jason-3 satellite from
Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The stage successfully touched down on the drone ship, landing 1.3
meters from the center of the painted target[82] at a suitable speed. However, a landing leg collet failed to lock,
and the stage again tipped over and was destroyed. The leg collet failure was attributed to frozen condensation
from fog at Vandenberg prior to launch.[83]
</p>

<p>
  On April 8, 2016, the first stage booster successfully landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You,[84][85]
marking the first time SpaceX successfully landed and recovered an orbitally launched rocket at sea.[85]
</p>

<p>
  On May 6, 2016, SpaceX landed the first stage of the Falcon 9 on Of Course I Still Love You during the JCSat-
14 mission, its second time successfully landing on a drone ship at sea.[86] This was the first time a booster on a
geostationary transfer mission landed successfully. This feat was repeated on May 27 during the Thaicom-8
mission.[87]
</p>

<h3>Setbacks</h3>
<a href="#header">Back to top</a>

<h4>Failed launch</h4>

<p>
  On June 28, 2015, CRS-7 launched a Falcon 9 topped with an unmanned Dragon capsule destined to bring
supplies to the International Space Station. All statistics were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the
flight when a cloud of vapor formed outside the craft, seen by the tracking camera. A few seconds after this
cloud formed, there was a loss of helium tank pressure, after which the tanks exploded and caused a complete
failure of the mission.[88] The software was not programmed to deploy the parachute for the Dragon capsule
after a launch mishap, therefore the Dragon broke up on impact.[89]
</p>

<p>
  The problem was discovered to be a failed strut on the helium pressure vessels that broke due to the force of
acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed helium to escape causing the demise of the spacecraft.
</p>

<p>
  SpaceX plans to move past the issue while also learning from it by inspecting each of the struts, like that which
failed, to ensure they have been manufactured correctly and will function properly. The software issue was also
fixed in addition to an analysis of the entire program in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for
future rockets and their payload.[90]
</p>

<p>
  SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell stated that in terms of the differences between the six previous successful
Falcon 9 Commercial Resupply Launches, â€œthere's nothing that stands out as being different for any particular
flight. Though the craft was set to bring a resupply of food and water to the ISS, the crew members had enough
supplies to last another 4 months before another resupply, which would end up being the Russian Progress 60P
vehicle.[91] Student science experiments as well as a docking adapter and other miscellaneous cargo was lost
due to CRS-7 failure as well.[92]
</p>

<h4>Issues in flight</h4>

<p>
  On March 1, 2013, a Dragon spacecraft in orbit developed issues with its thrusters. Due to blocked fuel valves,
the craft was unable to properly control itself. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages.
Because of this issue, the craft arrived at and docked with the International Space Station one day later than
expected. Since spacecraft like the Dragon are classified as munitions and considered weapons under arms
regulations, SpaceX Mission controllers were unable to release more information to the public.[93]
